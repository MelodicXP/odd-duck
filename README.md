# Class 201 - Lab 11, 12, 13, 15b

## Odd-Duck

I built an app with the purpose of presenting three different product images to employees to vote on. After each 25 rounds of voting, the results of votes and views for each product image will be displayed on a bar chart. The product with the most votes will determine the next product creation for the company.

### Reflections and Comments

#### July 11, 2023

* No changes made as per lab 15b requirements.

#### July 7, 2023  

* I learned to utilize local storage by keeping voting data in tact in between page refreshes.
* Data storage and retrieval is accomplished with JSON and Parse.
* Reconstructing objects when retrieving from local storage is preferred when implementing prototypes.

#### July 4, 2023  

* I learned how to integrate ChartJS into projects by using canvas element in HTML with an ID, and then within Javascript use DOM to manipulate it. Within HTML must include script tag in order to use ChartJS library.
* To improve readability and understanding chartObj was separated into smaller subsections.
* How to apply styling to elements using DOM, (only wanted for chart to appear once all voting rounds completed).

#### June 27, 2023

* I learned quite a bit about innerHTML and outerHTML and how to use it to manipulate the text elements such as applying 'bold' using JavaConsider.
* I learned about grid and how to set he minimum and maxiumum sizes for columns and rows with grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows.
* I learned about grid layout as opposed to flex.
