# Class 201 - Lab 11

## Odd-Duck

I built an app with the purpose of presenting three different product images to employees to vote on. After 25 rounds of voting, the results of votes and views for each product image will be displayed. The product with the most votes will determine the next product creation for the company.

### Reflections and Comments

* I learned quite a bit about innerHTML and outerHTML and how to use it to manipulate the text elements such as applying 'bold' using JavaConsider.
* I learned about grid and how to set he minimum and maxiumum sizes for columns and rows with grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows.
* I learned about grid layout as opposed to flex.
